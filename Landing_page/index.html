          <h2>Healthy Food</h2>
          <p>
            A healthy diet is a diet that helps maintain or improve overall health. A healthy diet provides the body
            with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate food energy.A healthy diet may
            contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food or sweetened
            beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based
            foods, although a non-plant source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on
            what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to
            allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.

          <h2>Exercise</h2>
          <p>Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and
            wellness.It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength preventing aging. </p>

          <p>Physical exercise is important for maintaining physical fitness and can contribute to maintaining a healthy
            weight, regulating the digestive system, building and maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength, and
            joint mobility, promoting physiological well-being, reducing surgical risks, and strengthening the immune
            system.</p>

          <h2>Meditation</h2>
          <p>Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind
            on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally
            clear and emotionally calm and stable state. Scholars have found meditation elusive to define, as practices
            vary both between traditions and within them.</p>

          <p> Meditation may significantly reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain and enhance peace,perception,
            self-concept, and well-being. Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on health
            (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.</p>

        <div class="landing__container">
          <h2>Relationship</h2>
          <p>There is empirical evidence of the causal impact of social relationships on health. The social support
            theory suggests that relationships might promote health especially by promoting adaptive behavior or
            regulating the stress response. </p>
          <p> Troubled relationships as well as loneliness and social exclusion may have negative consequences on
            health. Neurosciences of health investigate the neuronal circuits implicated in the context of both social
            connection and disconnection.</p>
