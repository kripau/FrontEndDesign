# Assignment 2: Landing page

## Project Summary
In this project, we have created an interactive multi-section landing page where DOM is automatically updated using Javascript. Following functionalities are implemented:
- Automatically generate the navigation bar associated with each section of the HTML body
- Highlight the navigation bar when clicked to indicate the active section
- Click action on the  navigation item at the top, scroll, and navigate to the corresponding section of the HTML page
- Highlight the corresponding section of the HTML page to differentiate from the rest of the sections by assigning the active CSS class to the section on both click on the navigation bar or manual scroll action
- Create a button on each section to scroll to the top of the page from each section
- Improve the performance of loading by using fragments while creating new elements

## Learning Scope
This project combines the understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts together to implement the functionality. Besides, using these three technologies, we have improved performance as well.
